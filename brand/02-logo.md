Where possible, make sure the logo is at least 24 pixels high. However, in severely limited space situations, such as mobile phone applications, the absolute minimum clear space requirement is 5 pixels.
Be sure the area is even, and free from any interfering graphics. The logo should be used on shadow or glow; do not change the colors.

Accessible Logos
The Intel logo is not considered a decorative image. Therefore, appropriate title text should be provided.  At the design phase, ensure the image has the ability to have title text added,

e.g., ensure the image is not a CSS background image.¹ The specific title text will depend on the individual usage of the logo, and what interactivity it represents, if any.

Note: The absolute minimum clear space requirement is 5 pixels.
 


 
Color Palette
Intel® Blue and the Color Palette . (see color guidelines page)
General Color Consideration
All colors across all software and digital applications must be chosen with contrast in mind and must be WCAG Level AA compliant.

Corporate Colors
Intel Blue is our corporate color and when combined with white, it provides the foundation of the Intel brand.

The Intel logo should appear in white on a solid Intel Blue background in all user interfaces.

For accessibility conformance, Intel Blue must be combined with only Lightest Gray and White from the official brand colors.

TM&B Rules
A basic set of trademark and branding rules for use within the Intel System Studio IDE that abide by the spirit and guidelines provided by the Intel Legal Trademark & Branding web site. 
 
 

When to Use the ® symbol:

Always use the ® symbol rather than the (R), unless using the ® symbol character cannot be applied. in which case you will have to use the (R) designator.
In splash screens for example when ISS starts, always use the proper trademarks, logos and icons. 
Use the proper trademarks, logos and icons in the “Help > About” dialogs and images, but not in the 'Help > About” menu itself.
Use the proper trademark in prominent titles In the product 'Welcome page” (aka “getting started guide”).  Most of that text comes from documentation who tend to apply the ® symbol too liberally per the TMB guidelines, so we may have less sway on trademark usage in that part of the product. 
The name of our product appears "prominently on the Eclipse main title bar when the app is running. It is recommended that we always use the proper trademark name (“Intel® System Studio”) in the product title bar.  A screenshot below this post shows where am talking about when say In the "title bar.
 

When to Leave the  ® symbol Out:

Some operating systems allow adding product names to a "Start Menu” item (i.e., Windows and some Linux desktops). where the product should just be referenced as "Intel System Studio": Including a ® in this context is too heavy and makes the menus difficult to read and difficult to search.
Likewise, some operating systems allow adding Icons to the desktop, which may also Include product names; including a ® In this context Is too heavy and makes the Icon titles difficult to read and difficult to search. For example, if we install a “start icon”. the product on the desktop, the icon should be “Intel System Studio” without the ® symbol or (R).
We should never use trademark symbols in menus within the product. This qualifies as “Overuse of the trademark ® symbols makes text menu difficult to read.” as stated in the Intel legal guidelines reproduced below.
 

POSTSCRIPT
The Intel TM&B guidelines are not explicit about trademark usage within an application, such as Intel System Studio thus the reason for the rules above will abide by the spirit and guidelines provide by the TM&B site. 

See this page from the TM&B site for their most explicit guidelines. The following text from that TM&B page is the closest to our usage scenario.

 

 
 
Typography: Intel® Clear
Intel Clear, our corporate font family, has been precisely engineered to improve the clarity of every brand communication by Intel in the digital space.
While not all examples in this guide show Intel Clear,

Intel Clear is the preferred font for Intel user interfaces.

Where it is not technically possible to use the Intel

Clear font, or if a language is not covered within the Intel Clear font family, use the native font from the operating system. For example, you could use the Segoe* UI typeface for Windows applications, Roboto or Droid Sans for the Android platform, or the San Francisco* font for Apple* devices.

Sentence-case text should always be used.

The Intel Clear Pro font is a secondary font within the Intel Clear font family. Because it provides less clarity than the Intel Clear font, it should only be for limited use.

Licensing

The Intel Clear font provided herein is the property of Intel Corporation and is provided for use in Intel specific deliverables only. Use is limited solely to Intel materials and should not be used for any other purposes. Intel claims all rights to the Intel Clear font.
