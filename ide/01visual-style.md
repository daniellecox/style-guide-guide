## Branding
Avoid branding, logos and graphics in your compoent except where identified.  Users will use your components alongside others as an itegraged experience, so keep the interface simple in order to offer a cleaner window space.  For questions about Intel branding, refer to the general branding guidelines.


## Text Style - 

For both IDEs use title case (means that the main words are capitalized and the “less important” words are lowercased) 

for all content use: sentence-style capitalization - That means everything is lowercase except the first word and proper nouns,


Use headline capitalization on all: Titles, menus, tabs and buttons


Use sentence style capitalization on all:
check boxes, radio buttons and group labels. 
For example, “Choose an option for the Java file” can be used as a group label.
Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. Do not include ending punctuation. Guideline Use Sentence style capitalization for all control labels in a dialog or window, including those for check boxes, radio buttons, group labels, and simple text fields. Capitalize the first letter of the first word, and any proper names such as the word Java.

Follow the existing Eclipse and Visual Studio conventions

## Fonts and colors in Eclipse
Eclipse uses the fonts and colors provided by the operating system as much as possible. On Windows the platform color and font settings are found on the Preferences > Colors and Fonts page. The font used by most widgets in Eclipse is the one set in the Message Box settings of the properties. However, operating systems do not provide enough colors to handle all of the extra information that colors and fonts provide in Eclipse. 



## Visual Style Guideline
Re-use the core visual concepts to maintain consistent representation and meaning across Eclipse plug-ins and functionality. 
Note: if writing a component that will not be integrated into the IDE, follow the IT Master Look and Feel Stylesheet
