When creating your plug-in, re-use the core visual concepts of the IDE to maintain consistent representation and meaning across plug-in functionality.

## Intel and OneAPI Branding in plug-ins
Avoid branding, logos and graphics in the plug-in, except where identified.  Because users will use your tool functionality alongside other tools as an itegraged experience, and because OneAPI is an Open Spec, proper brand placement is an important consideration. 
For questions about Intel tool names or when/how to use the registered trademark name in the UI, refer to the <a href="https://daniellecox.github.io/style-guide-guide/brand.html" target="_blank">general branding guidelines page</a>.
