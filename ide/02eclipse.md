## Eclipse UI Patterns and Buiding Blocks
All elements in the Eclipse interface are derived from the plug-in and workbench concepts. Plugins provide functionality and control and are implemented as structured subsystems in the platform.  The workbench is the cockpit for navigating all that is provided by the plug-ins.  
UI controls and Eclipse components are provided with the platform and come in the form of widgets, windows, dialogs, menus, and wizards, which define a framework for building deep user interactions.
The GUI elements in are defined by the Standard Widget Toolkit plug-in ( org.eclipse.swt.widgets ).
