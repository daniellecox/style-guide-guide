<h2 id="overview">Trademark & Branding in OneAPI GUIs</h2>
A basic set of trademark and branding rules for use within OneAPI that abide by the spirit and guidelines provided by the Legal Trademark & Branding web site. 

<h3 id="symbol">When to USE the ® symbol</h3>
Always use the ® symbol rather than the (R), unless using the ® symbol character cannot be applied. in which case you will have to use the (R) designator.
In splash screens for example when ISS starts, always use the proper trademarks, logos and icons. 
Use the proper trademarks, logos and icons in the “Help > About” dialogs and images, but not in the 'Help > About” menu itself.
Use the proper trademark in prominent titles In the product 'Welcome page” (aka “getting started guide”).  Most of that text comes from documentation who tend to apply the ® symbol too liberally per the TMB guidelines, so we may have less sway on trademark usage in that part of the product. 
The name of our product appears "prominently on the Eclipse main title bar when the app is running. It is recommended that we always use the proper trademark name (“Intel® System Studio”) in the product title bar.  A screenshot below this post shows where am talking about when say In the "title bar.
 
<h3 id="no">When to NOT use the ® symbol</h3>
Some operating systems allow adding product names to a "Start Menu” item (i.e., Windows and some Linux desktops). where the product should just be referenced as "Intel System Studio": Including a ® in this context is too heavy and makes the menus difficult to read and difficult to search.
Likewise, some operating systems allow adding Icons to the desktop, which may also Include product names; including a ® In this context Is too heavy and makes the Icon titles difficult to read and difficult to search. For example, if we install a “start icon”. the product on the desktop, the icon should be “Intel System Studio” without the ® symbol or (R).  We should never use trademark symbols in menus within the product. This qualifies as “Overuse of the trademark ® symbols makes text menu difficult to read.” as stated in the Intel legal guidelines reproduced below.
