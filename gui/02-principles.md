From Corporate: Intel Design Language for User Interface
 
Start With the End User
We earn the right to personalize the experience for our users by having empathy for them, by being clear about what we say, and transparent about what we do. When we do this, we establish a relationship built on trust that grows over time and brings end users more value with each interaction.

Earn Their Trust
We earn the right to personalize the experience for our users by having empathy for them, by being clear about what we say, and transparent about what we do. When we do this, we establish a relationship built on trust that grows over time and brings end users more value with each interaction.

Nudge When Needed
We inspire intuitive action by giving perceivable hints, feedback, and cues that nudge our users in the right direction naturally and easily. By guiding them, we make our users feel more confident and help them overcome a natural resistance to change.

Build with a Single Focus
We define the primary function of our products in simple, user-centric terms so that our product evolves with a single focus and clear value that our users can understand. This in turn makes decision, making clearâ€”what enhances the primary functionality stays, and the rest goes.

Craft Shows Care
We demonstrate the integrity of our products by paying attention to detail, both in design and execution. When we do this, we not only give users a reason to believe in us, but we show that we value their choice to use our products and services.

Be Consistent and Familiar
When we establish patterns that are consistent within an experience and familiar across contexts, we help our users do more with less effort each time. The result is the creation of an experience that is easy to use and distinctly Intel.
